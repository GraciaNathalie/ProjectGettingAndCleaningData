x : combination of x_train and x_test
y: combination of y_train and y_test
Subject: combination of train and test subject

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

The extracted data is in the variable ExtractedData, made by selecting subject and code containing

3. Use desc activity names to name the activities in the data set
numbers in code column are replaced with the corresponding activity

4. Appropriate labelling
in All_Data, all label were changed from 
t = time
f = frequency
Acc = Accelerometer
Gyro = Gyroscope
Mag = Magnitude
BodyBody = Body
